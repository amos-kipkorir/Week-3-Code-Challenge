# Week-3-Code-Challenge
#  Blog Post Manager App

A simple frontend application that interacts with a local JSON API to **view**, **create**, **edit**, and **delete** blog posts using **vanilla JavaScript** and **JSON Server**.

##  Demo

 Imagine a GIF here:
 - Page loads with a list of blog post titles.
 - Clicking a title shows full details (title, content, author).
 - A form allows adding new posts.
 - "Edit" and "Delete" buttons appear for each post.

##  Features

###  Core Features
- View all blog post titles and thumbnails on page load.
- Click a post title to view full details (title, content, author).
- Add a new post using the "New Post" form.

### Advanced Features
- First post’s details displayed by default on page load.
- Edit post title and content directly in an inline form.
- Delete a post from the list and clear the detail section.

###  Extra Advanced (Full API Integration)
- Send a POST request to persist new posts.
- Send a PATCH request to persist post updates.
- Send a DELETE request to permanently remove posts.
